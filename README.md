<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This library is an educational proof of concept about extracting popular times from a simple Google search. It should
not be used in a production ready application.

For example, if you search 'Museo del prado', you will obtain something like this:

```
PopularTimes(days=[Day(status=OPEN, hours=[Hour(hour=6, percent=0, message=), Hour(hour=7, percent=0, message=), Hour(hour=8, percent=0, message=), Hour(hour=9, percent=0, message=), Hour(hour=10,
